      <h1>Metal vs. Tile Roofs in South Florida (HVHZ Guide)</h1>
      <p class="byline">By All Phase Construction USA • Roofing &amp; General Contractor • Deerfield Beach, FL</p>

      <p>
        If you're a homeowner or condo board member in Broward or Palm Beach County considering a new roof, you're probably weighing two of the most popular options: metal roofing and tile roofing. Both systems can meet Florida Building Code requirements in the High Velocity Hurricane Zone (HVHZ), but they perform differently in terms of wind resistance, lifespan, maintenance, cost, and insurance impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        This guide breaks down the key differences so you can make an informed decision based on your property, budget, and long-term goals.
      </p>

      <h2>What is the High Velocity Hurricane Zone (HVHZ)?</h2>

      <p>
        The HVHZ includes Broward and Miami-Dade counties and requires roofing systems to meet stricter wind-resistance standards than other parts of Florida. Roofs must be engineered to withstand sustained winds of at least 140 mph, with enhanced fastening patterns, underlayment, and structural tie-ins.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both metal and tile roofs can be designed and installed to meet HVHZ requirements—but the details matter. Proper engineering, permitting, and installation are critical to passing inspection and qualifying for insurance discounts.
      </p>

      <h2>Metal Roofing in the HVHZ</h2>

      <h3>Types of Metal Roofs</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standing Seam Metal:</strong> Panels run vertically with raised seams; fasteners are concealed. Excellent wind uplift resistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Mechanically Seamed Metal:</strong> Panels are crimped together with special equipment, creating a continuous weathertight surface. Common in commercial and high-performance residential applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Metal Shingles or Panels:</strong> Designed to mimic traditional roofing materials. Performance depends on fastening and engineering.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Advantages of Metal Roofing</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Superior Wind Resistance:</strong> When properly installed, metal roofs can exceed HVHZ requirements and resist wind uplift better than most other systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Long Lifespan:</strong> Metal roofs typically last 40–70 years, depending on the material (galvanized steel, aluminum, or coated steel).</li>
        <li><strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> Metal is resistant to cracking, rot, and pest damage. Minimal upkeep required over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Reflective coatings reduce heat absorption, potentially lowering cooling costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> Metal is lighter than tile, reducing structural load and making it easier to install on older buildings.</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance Benefits:</strong> Metal roofs often qualify for the highest wind mitigation credits, which can reduce premiums significantly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Disadvantages of Metal Roofing</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Higher Upfront Cost:</strong> Metal roofs are more expensive than shingles and may cost more than tile, depending on the type.</li>
        <li><strong>Noise:</strong> Some homeowners find metal roofs noisier during heavy rain (though proper insulation and underlayment can reduce this).</li>
        <li><strong>Denting:</strong> Lower-grade metal panels can dent from hail or falling branches, though high-quality materials are more resistant.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tile Roofing in the HVHZ</h2>

      <h3>Types of Tile Roofs</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Concrete Tile:</strong> Affordable, durable, and widely used in South Florida. Available in various profiles (flat, S-tile, barrel).</li>
        <li><strong>Clay Tile:</strong> Traditional, higher-end option with a longer lifespan and better color retention. More expensive than concrete.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Advantages of Tile Roofing</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Proven Performance:</strong> Tile has been used in South Florida for decades and performs well when properly installed with HVHZ fastening.</li>
        <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> Concrete tile lasts 40–50 years; clay tile can last 70+ years with minimal maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Fire Resistance:</strong> Tile is non-combustible and provides excellent fire protection.</li>
        <li><strong>Aesthetic Variety:</strong> Available in multiple colors, profiles, and finishes to match architectural styles.</li>
        <li><strong>Thermal Performance:</strong> Tile provides natural insulation, helping to regulate attic temperatures.</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance Credits:</strong> Tile roofs can qualify for wind mitigation discounts, especially when installed with enhanced fastening systems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Disadvantages of Tile Roofing</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Tile is significantly heavier than metal. Older structures may require additional framing or structural reinforcement.</li>
        <li><strong>Breakage:</strong> Individual tiles can crack or break from impacts (e.g., tree branches, foot traffic during maintenance). Replacements are usually straightforward but add to maintenance costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Installation Complexity:</strong> Tile installation requires more labor and time, increasing upfront costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Underlayment Lifespan:</strong> The underlayment beneath tile typically lasts 20–30 years and may need replacement before the tiles themselves wear out.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Head-to-Head Comparison</h2>

      <h3>Wind Resistance</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Winner: Metal.</strong> When engineered correctly, metal roofs offer superior wind uplift resistance. Standing seam and mechanically seamed systems are especially effective. Tile can meet HVHZ standards, but fastening patterns and tile profile matter significantly.
      </p>

      <h3>Lifespan</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Tie.</strong> Both materials are long-lasting. Metal lasts 40–70 years; clay tile can exceed 70 years. Concrete tile lasts 40–50 years. Underlayment replacement is a factor for tile.
      </p>

      <h3>Maintenance</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Winner: Metal.</strong> Metal requires minimal maintenance. Tile requires periodic inspection for cracks and underlayment condition.
      </p>

      <h3>Cost</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Winner: Tile (concrete).</strong> Concrete tile is generally less expensive upfront than premium metal systems. Clay tile and high-end metal are comparable. Installation complexity adds to tile costs.
      </p>

      <h3>Weight</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Winner: Metal.</strong> Metal is significantly lighter, making it ideal for structures where weight is a concern or structural reinforcement would be costly.
      </p>

      <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Winner: Personal preference.</strong> Tile offers a traditional Mediterranean or Spanish look. Metal provides a modern, clean appearance. Both can suit South Florida architecture.
      </p>

      <h3>Insurance Impact</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Winner: Metal (slightly).</strong> Both qualify for wind mitigation credits, but metal roofs often receive higher ratings due to superior uplift performance. Actual savings depend on your insurer and property details.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Regardless of material, proper installation, engineering, and permitting are critical. A poorly installed metal or tile roof will underperform and may not qualify for insurance discounts or pass inspection.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Which Should You Choose?</h2>

      <p><strong>Choose Metal If:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You want the highest wind resistance and insurance credits.</li>
        <li>Your building structure cannot support heavy tile.</li>
        <li>You prefer low-maintenance systems with minimal long-term upkeep.</li>
        <li>You're willing to pay more upfront for long-term performance and energy savings.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Choose Tile If:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You prefer the traditional aesthetic and have a structure that can support the weight.</li>
        <li>Your budget favors a lower upfront cost (concrete tile).</li>
        <li>You're comfortable with periodic maintenance and inspections.</li>
        <li>You want proven performance with decades of local track record.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Working with a Qualified Contractor</h2>

      <p>
        Whether you choose metal or tile, make sure your contractor is experienced with HVHZ installations, licensed as both a roofing contractor and general contractor (for structural work if needed), and familiar with local permitting and engineering requirements.
